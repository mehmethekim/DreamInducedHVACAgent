# Dream Induced HVAC Agent for Smart Building Systems

Welcome to the repository for enhancing HVAC control using reinforcement learning! ðŸš€

## Overview

This project aims to improve the performance of a HVAC controller using various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The step-by-step plan includes:

1. **DQN or PPO Integration**
   - [ ] Enhance the controller using Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms.
   - [ ] Evaluate the performance of the RL-enhanced controller compared to the existing rule-based controller.

2. **RNN Integration**
   - [ ] Integrate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to capture the temporal dependencies in the system.
   - [ ] Assess the predictive properties of the RNN-enhanced controller.

3. **VAE Integration**
   - [ ] Implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently capture system parameters.
   - [ ] Evaluate the performance of the VAE-enhanced controller and compare it with previous approaches.

4. **MDN Integration in Dream Environment**
   - [ ] Utilize Mixture Density Networks (MDN) in the dream environment.
   - [ ] Train the MDN in the dream environment to enhance the controller's adaptability.
